              We will collect personal information by lawful and fair means and,

          <p>
            Like most web servers on the Internet, this website’ servers
            maintain access logs that record web browser activity. These logs
            associate an Internet Protocol (IP) address with each request for
            content from the servers. When you visit this web site, our web
            server automatically collects a limited amount of standard
            information essential to the operation and evaluation of the web
            site. This information includes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>the page from which you arrived,</li>
            <li>the date and time of your page request,</li>
            <li>
              the IP address your computer is using to receive information,
            </li>
            <li>the type and version of your browser, and</li>
            <li>the name and size of the file you request.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This information is collected in order to help make our site more
            useful to visitors, to learn about the number of visitors to our
            site, and to learn about the types of technology our visitors use.
            We do not track information about individuals and their visit.

          <h2>Cookies</h2>
          <p>
            We may use ‘cookies’ that identify you as a return visitor. A cookie

          <p>
            Our website may contain links to enable you to visit other websites
            of interest easily. However, once you have used these links to leave

            ‘spam’ (unsolicited marketing e-mail). If you agree to receive
            e-mail communications from us, every e-mail message we send you will
            include an e-mail address to which you can respond. If at any time
            you decide you do not want to receive marketing e-mail from us,
            simply let us know and we will remove your name and e-mail address
            from our marketing lists. We will do the same with your mailing
